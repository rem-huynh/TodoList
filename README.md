## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Highlights

Add tasks with validation (rejects blank/whitespace).
View tasks with 1-based indexing and completion status ([ ] / [x]).
Mark tasks complete (updates Task state) and delete tasks with confirmation.
Clean Task model (private fields, getters/setters, toString) and small static helpers in Main.
